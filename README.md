# Backend API - Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This is the backend API for expense tracking app. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to handle server-side operations, including database connections and API routes.

## Features

- **REST API**: The server provides various routes to interact with the data.
- **MongoDB Integration**: MongoDB is used as the database to store data.
- **Environment Configuration**: Sensitive information such as the database URL and port are stored in an `.env` file.
- **Development Server**: Uses `npm run dev` for easy development setup and live reloading.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (either locally installed or a cloud database like MongoDB Atlas)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wallelign/backend_finance_tracking_app.git
cd backend_finance_tracking_app
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
PORT=5000
```

- **MONGODB_URL**: The connection string for your MongoDB database. If using MongoDB Atlas or a cloud instance, replace this with the appropriate URL.
- **PORT**: The port on which your server will run (default is `5000`).

> **Note**: If you are using MongoDB Atlas, your URL will look like this:
>
> ```env
> MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/your-database-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority
> ```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the server using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for automatic restarts during development. The API server will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## API Endpoints

Here are some example API endpoints your backend might have:

    // Income routes
    `post /income` Adds a new income to the database.
    `get /income` Fetches all incomes from the database.
    `get /income/current` Fetches current month income from the database.
    `get /income/:id` Fetches income from the database.
    `put /income/:id` Updates an income by ID.
    `delete /income/:id` Deletes an income by ID.

    // route Balance
    `get /balance` Fetches net balance from the database.

    // Expense routes
    `post /expense` Adds a new expense to the database.
    `get /expense` Fetches all expenses from the database.
    `get /expense/current` Fetches current month expense from the database.
    `get /expense/:id` Fetches expense from the database.
    `put /expense/:id` Updates an expense by ID.
    `delete /expense/:id` Deletes an expense by ID.
